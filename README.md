Elara: Mood-Based Story and Image Generator using LLM and Stable Diffusion.

# 🌌 Elara: Mood-Based Story and Image Generator using LLM and Stable Diffusion

Elara is a multimodal generative AI system that combines the power of large language models and text-to-image diffusion models to create immersive storytelling experiences. With just a short prompt and a mood selection, Elara generates both a short story and a matching image—bringing creativity to life in both words and visuals.

## ✨ Demo Output

> **Prompt:** *"A robot exploring an abandoned city"*  
> **Mood:** *Sci-Fi*  
> 📝 **Story:**  
> *In a forgotten metropolis under twin moons, the robot wandered alone.  
> Each building whispered tales of vanished humans.  
> It paused beside a rusted playground, scanning for signs of life.  
> Only silence answered, echoing in steel and shadow.  
> Still, it marched on—hope flickering in its synthetic heart.*

## 🎮 How It Works

Prompt Input: User enters a short phrase (e.g., "a cat flying a spaceship").

Mood Selection: Choose from Fantasy, Funny, Sad, Sci-Fi, Adventure, or Romantic.

Story Generation: LLaMA3 via Groq API creates a 4–6 line story matching the mood.

Image Generation: Stable Diffusion v1.5 synthesizes an image from the prompt.

Result Display: Story and image are shown side by side in the Gradio web app.

Generated text:
In the heart of Nova Haven, a magnificent dragon named Lyra stood before a holographic blackboard, her scales shimmering with iridescent hues. With a flick of her claw, she conjured a swirling vortex, illustrating the principles of superposition. Her students, a diverse group of aliens and humans, gazed in awe as Lyra effortlessly juggled particles and waves, demystifying the mysteries of quantum entanglement. As the lesson concluded, Lyra bestowed upon her pupils a knowing glance, and the classroom resonated with the whispered secrets of the cosmos.
